Internet-Draft      Network Slice Service YANG Model        October 2023


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG [RFC7950] data model for the IETF
   Network Slice Service as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices].

   This YANG module can be used in the IETF Network Slice Service
   Interface exposed by a provider to its customers in order to manage
   (e.g., subscribe, delete, or change) IETF Network Slice Services.
   The agreed service will then trigger the appropriate IETF Network
   Slice operation, such as instantiating, modifying, or deleting an
   IETF Network Slice.

   As discussed in [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices], the mapping
   between an IETF Network Slice Service and its realization is
   implementation and deployment specific.

   The IETF Network Slice Service Model (NSSM) focuses on the
   requirements of an IETF Network Slice Service from the point of view
   of the customer, not how it is implemented within a provider network.
   The module is classified as customer service model (Section 2 of
   [RFC8309]).

   The IETF Network Slice Service YANG model conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342].

   Editorial Note: (To be removed by RFC Editor)

   This document contains several placeholder values that need to be
   replaced with finalized values at the time of publication.  Please

   *  "XXXX" -- the assigned RFC value for this draft both in this draft
      and in the YANG models under the revision statement.

   *  The "revision" date in model, in the format XXXX-XX-XX, needs to
      be updated with the date the draft gets approved.

3.  IETF Network Slice Service Overview

   As defined in Section 3.2 of [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices], an
   IETF Network Slice Service is specified in terms of a set of SDPs, a
   set of one or more connectivity constructs between subsets of these
   SDPs, and a set of SLOs and SLEs for each SDP sending to each
   connectivity construct.  A communication type (point- to-point (P2P),
   point-to-multipoint (P2MP), or any-to-any (A2A)) is specified for
   each connectivity construct.

   The SDPs serve as the IETF Network Slice Service ingress/egress
   points.  An SDP is identified by a unique identifier in the context
   of an IETF Network Slice Service.

   Examples of IETF Network Slice Services that contain only one
   connectivity construct are shown in Figure 1.

             Figure 2: Examples of IETF Network Slice Services

   As shown in Figure 2, the IETF Network Slice Service 4 contains two
   P2P connectivity constructs between the set of SDPs.  The IETF
   Network Slice Service 5 is a bidirectional unicast service between
   SDP14 and SDP15 that consists of two unidirectional P2P connectivity
   constructs.

4.  IETF Network Slice Service Model (NSSM) Usage

   The NSSM can be used by a provider to expose its IETF Network Slice
   Service, and by a customer to manage its IETF Network Slices Services
   (e.g., request, delete, or modify).  The details about how service
   requests are handled by the provider, including which network
   operations are triggered, are internal to the provider.  The details
   of the IETF Network Slices realization are hidden from customers.

   The IETF Network Slices are applicable to use cases, such as (but not
   limited to) network wholesale services, network infrastructure
   sharing among operators, Network Function Virtualization (NFV)
   connectivity, Data Center interconnect, and 5G.

Internet-Draft      Network Slice Service YANG Model        October 2023


   An IETF Network Slice Controller (NSC) is an entity that exposes the
   IETF Network Slice Service Interface to customers to manage IETF
   Network Slice Services.  Typically, an NSC receives requests from its
   customer-facing interface (e.g., from a management system).  During
   service creation, this interface can convey data objects that the
   IETF Network Slice Service customer provides, describing the needed
   IETF Network Slices Service in terms of a set of SDPs, the associated
   connectivity constructs, and the service objectives that the customer
   wishes to be fulfilled.  These service requirements are then
   translated into technology-specific actions that are implemented in
   the underlying network using a network-facing interface.  The details
   of how the IETF Network Slices are put into effect are out of scope
   for this document.

   As shown in Figure 3, in all the use cases, the NSSM is used by the
   customer's higher level operation system to communicate with the NSC
   for life cycle management of IETF Network Slices including both
   enablement and monitoring.  For example, in the 5G E2E (End-to-end)
   network slicing use-case the E2E network slice orchestrator acts as
   the higher layer system to request the IETF Network Slices.  The
   interface is used to support dynamic IETF Network Slice creation and
   its lifecycle management to facilitate end-to-end network slice
   services.

        Figure 3: IETF Network Slice Service Reference Architecture

   Note: The NSSM can be recursive (hierarchical mode), i.e., an NSSM
   can map a child NSS.  As described in Section A.5 of
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices], the IETF Network Slice Service
   can support a recursive composite architecture that allows one layer
   of IETF Network Slice Services to be used by other layers.

5.  IETF Network Slice Service Model (NSSM) Description

   The NSSM, "ietf-network-slice-service", includes two main data nodes:
   "slice-service" and "slo-sle-templates" (see Figure 4).

Internet-Draft      Network Slice Service YANG Model        October 2023


   The "slice-service" list includes the set of IETF Network Slice
   Services that are maintained by a provider. "slice-service" is the
   data structure that abstracts the IETF Network Slice Service.  Under
   the "slice-service", the "sdp" list is used to abstract the SDPs.
   The "connection-group" is used to abstract connectivity constructs
   between SDPs.

   The "slo-sle-templates" container is used by an NSC to maintain a set
   of common network slice SLO and SLE templates that apply to one or
   several IETF Network Slice Services.

   The figure below describes the overall structure of the NSSM:

   module: ietf-network-slice-service
     +--rw network-slice-services
        +--rw slo-sle-templates
        |  +--rw slo-sle-template* [id]

        +--rw slice-service* [id]
           +--rw id                              string
           +--rw description?                    string
           +--rw service-tags
           |     ...
           +--rw (slo-sle-policy)?

   The "slo-sle-templates" container (Figure 4) is used by an IETF
   Network Slice Service provider to define and maintain a set of common
   IETF Network Slice Service templates that apply to one or several
   IETF Network Slice Services.  The exact definition of the templates
   is deployment specific to each network provider.

   The NSSM includes the identifiers of SLO and SLE templates and the
   common attributes defined in Section 5.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices].  Considering that there are many
   attributes defined and some attributes could vary with service
   requirements, e.g., bandwidth, or latency, multiple standard
   templates as well as custom "service-slo-sle-policy" are defined:

   1:  Standard template with no attribute specified: The exact
       definition of the templates is deployment specific to the
       provider.

   2:  Standard template with attributes specified: Provides the
       customers with the ability to define templates, or reference a
       predefined template "template-ref" and override specific
       attributes, and apply them to IETF Network Slice Service
       configuration.

   3:  Custom "service-slo-sle-policy": More description is provided in
       Section 5.2.3.

   The following shows an example where two network slice templates can
   be retrieved by the customers:

5.2.  IETF Network Slice Services

   The "slice-service" is the data structure that abstracts an IETF
   Network Slice Service, which is uniquely identified by "id" specified
   in the context of an NSC.

   An IETF Network Slice Service has the following main parameters:

   *  "id": Is an unique identifier for internal management reference of
      the IETF Network Slice Service within an NSC.

   *  "description": Provides a textual description of an IETF Network
      Slice Service.

   *  "service-tags": Indicates a management tag (e.g.  "customer-name"
      ) that is used to correlate the operational information of
      Customer Higher-level Operation System and IETF Network Slices.
      It might be used by IETF Network Slice Service operator to provide
      additional information to the NSC during the automation of the
      IETF network slices.  E.g. adding tags with "customer-name" when
      multiple actual customers use a same network slice service.
      Another use-case for "service-tag" might be for an operator to
      provide additional attributes to NSC which might be used during
      the realization of IETF Network Slice Services such as type of
      services (e.g., Layer 2 or Layer 3 service).  These additional
      attributes can also be used by an NSC for various use-cases such
      as monitoring and assurance of the IETF Network Slice Services
      where the NSC can notify the customer system by issuing the
      notifications.  Note that all these attributes are OPTIONAL but
      might be useful for some use-cases.

   *  "slo-sle-policy": Defines SLO and SLE policies for the "slice-
      service".  More details are provided in Section 5.2.3.

   *  "compute-only": Is used to check the feasibility before
      instantiating a Network Slice Service.  More details are provided
      in Section 5.2.6.

   *  "status": Is used to show the operative and administrative status
      of the IETF Network Slice Service, and can be used as indicator to
      detect network slice anomalies.

   *  "sdps": Represents a set of SDPs that are involved in the IETF
      Network Slice Service with each "sdp" belonging to a single
      "slice-service".  More details are provided in Section 5.2.1.

   *  "connection-groups": Abstracts the connections to the set of SDPs
      of the IETF Network Slice Service.

5.2.1.  IETF Network Slice Service Demarcation Points

   An SDP belong to a single IETF Network Slice Service.  An IETF
   Network Slice Service involves two or more SDPs.  An IETF Network
   Slice Service can be modified by adding new "sdp" or removing
   existing "sdp".

   Section 5.2 of [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices] describes four
   possible ways in which an SDP may be placed:

   *  Within CE

   *  Provider-facing ports on the CE

   *  Customer-facing ports on the PE

   *  Within PE

   Although there are four options, they can be categorized into two:
   CE-based or PE-based.  To simplify the model, the NSC and the
   customer's system can agree on the choice of these two types without
   marking the type on each SDP.

Internet-Draft      Network Slice Service YANG Model        October 2023


   In the four options, the Attachment Circuit (AC) may be part of the
   IETF Network Slice Service or may be external to it.  Based on the
   definition of AC in Section 5.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices], the customer and provider may
   agree on a per {IETF Network Slice Service, connectivity construct,
   and SLOs/SLEs} basis to police or shape traffic on the AC in both the
   ingress (CE to PE) direction and egress (PE to CE) direction, which
   ensures that the traffic is within the capacity profile that is
   agreed in an IETF Network Slice Service.  Excess traffic is dropped
   by default, unless specific out-of-profile policies are agreed
   between the customer and the provider.

   To abstract the SDP options and SLOs/SLEs profiles, an SDP has the
   following characteristics:

   *  "id": Uniquely identifies the SDP within the Network Slice
      Controller (NSC).  The identifier is a string that allows any
      encoding for the local administration of the IETF Network Slice
      Service.

   *  "location": Indicates SDP location information, which helps the
      NSC to identify an SDP.

   *  "node-id": A reference to the node that hosts the SDP, which helps
      the NSC to identify an SDP.

   *  "sdp-ip-address": The SDP IP information, which helps the NSC to
      identify an SDP.

   *  "tp-ref": A reference to a Termination Point (TP) in the custom
      topology defined in Section 5.2.5.

   *  "incoming-qos-policy" and "outgoing-qos-policy": Sets the incoming
      and outgoing QoS policies to apply on a given SDP, including QoS
      policy and specific ingress and egress traffic limits to ensure
      access security.  When applied in the incoming direction, the
      policy is applicable to the traffic that passes through the AC
      from the customer network or from another provider's network to
      the Network Slice.  When applied in the outgoing direction, the
      policy is applied to the traffic from the Network Slice towards
      the customer network or towards another provider's network.  If an
      SDP has multiple ACs, the "rate-limits" of "attachment-circuit"
      can be set to an AC specific value, but the rate cannot exceed the
      "rate-limits" of the SDP.  If an SDP only contains a single AC,
      then the "rate-limits" of "attachment-circuit" is the same with
      the SDP.  The definition of AC refers to Section 5.2
      [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices].

Internet-Draft      Network Slice Service YANG Model        October 2023


   *  "ac-svc-name": Indicates the names of AC services, for association
      purposes, to refer to the ACs that have been created.  When both
      "ac-svc-name" and the attributes of "attachment-circuits" are
      defined, the "ac-svc-name" takes precedence.

   *  "attachment-circuits": Specifies the list of ACs by which the
      service traffic is received.  This is an optional SDP attribute.
      When an SDP has multiple ACs and some AC specific attributes are
      needed, each "attachment-circuit" can specify attributes, such as
      interface specific IP addresses, service MTU, etc.

   *  "sdp-peering": Specifies the peers and peering protocols for an
      SDP to exchange control-plane information, e.g.  Layer 1 signaling
      protocol or Layer 3 routing protocols, etc.

      -  "peer-sap-id": Indicates the references to the remote endpoints
         of attachment circuits.  This information can be used for
         correlation purposes, such as identifying Service Attachment
         Points (SAPs) defined in [RFC9408], which defines a model of an
         abstract view of the provider network topology that contains
         the points from which the services can be attached.

      -  "protocols": Serves as an augmentation target.  Appendix A The
         example protocols of an SDP can be BGP, static routing, etc.

   *  "status": Enables the control of the operative and administrative
      status of the SDP, can be used as indicator to detect SDP
      anomalies.

   *  "service-match-criteria": Defines matching policies for the IETF
      Network Slice Service traffic to apply on a given SDP.

   Depending on the requirements of different cases, "service-match-
   criteria" can be used for the following purposes:

   *  Specify the AC type: physical or logical connection

   *  Distinguish the SDP traffic if the SDP is located in the CE or PE

   *  Distinguish the traffic of different connection groups (CGs) or
      connectivity constructs (CCs) when multiple CGs/CCs of different
      SLO/SLE may be set up between the same pair of SDPs, as
      illustrated in Figure 5.  Traffic needs to be explicitly mapped
      into the IETF Network Slice's specific connectivity construct.
      The policies, "service-match-criteria", are based on the values in
      which combination of layer 2 and layer 3 header and payload fields
      within a packet to identify to which {IETF Network Slice Service,
      connectivity construct, and SLOs/SLEs} that packet is assigned.

   *  Define specific out-of-profile policies: The customer may choose
      to use an explicit "service-match-criteria" to map any SDP's
      traffic or a subset of the SDP's traffic to a specific connection
      group or connectivity construct.  If a subset of traffic is
      matched (e.g. dscp-match) and mapped to a connectivity construct,
      the customer may choose to add a subsequent "match-any" to
      explicitly map the remaining SDP traffic to a separate
      connectivity construct.  If the customer chooses to implicitly map
      remaining traffic and if there is no additional connectivity
      constructs where the "sdp-id" source is specified, then that
      traffic will be dropped.

                  Figure 5: Application of Match Criteria

   If an SDP is placed at the port or AC of a CE or PE, and there is
   only one single connectivity construct with a source at the SDP,
   traffic can be implicitly mapped to this connectivity construct since
   the port or AC can be used to identify the traffic and the SDP is the
   only source of the connectivity-construct.  Appendix B.1 shows an
   example of both the implicit and explicit approaches.

   While explicit matching is optional in some use cases, it provides a
   more clear and readable implementation, but the choice is left to the
   operator.

   To illustrate the use of SDP options, the below are two examples.
   How the NSC realize the mapping is out of scope for this document.

*  SDPs at customer-facing ports on the PEs: As shown in Figure 6 , a
   customer of the IETF Network Slice Service would like to connect
   two SDPs to satisfy specific service, e.g., network wholesale
   services.  In this case, the IETF network slice SDPs are mapped to
   customer-facing ports of PE nodes.  The NSC uses "node-id" (PE
   device ID), "attachment-circuits" (ACs) to map SDPs to the
   customer-facing ports on the PEs.

*  SDPs within CEs: As shown in Figure 7 , a customer of the IETF
   Network Slice Service would like to connect two SDPs to provide
   connectivity between transport portion of 5G RAN to 5G Core
   network functions.  In this scenario, the NSC uses "node-id" (CE
   device ID), "sdp-ip-address" (IP of SDP for management), "service-
   match-criteria" (VLAN tag), "attachment-circuits" (CE ACs) to map
   SDPs to the CE.  The NSC can use these CE parameters (and
   optionally the "peer-sap-id") to retrieve the corresponding PE
   device, interface and AC mapping details to complete the end-to-
   end network slice service provisioning (the implementation details
   are left to the NSC provider).

5.2.2.  IETF Network Slice Service Connectivity Constructs

   Based on the customer's service traffic requirements, an IETF Network
   Slice Service connectivity type could be point-to-point (P2P), point-
   to-multipoint (P2MP), any-to-any (A2A) or a combination of these
   types.

   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices] defines the basic connectivity
   construct (CC) for an IETF Network Slice Service, and the
   connectivity construct may have different SLO and SLE requirements.
   "connectivity-construct" represents this connectivity construct, and
   "slo-sle-policy" under it represents the per-connectivity construct
   SLO and SLE requirements.

   Apart from the per-connectivity construct SLO and SLE, slice service
   traffic is usually managed by combining similar types of traffic.
   For example, some connections for video services require high
   bandwidth, and some connections for voice over IP request low latency
   and reliability.

   "connection-group" is thus defined to treat each type as a class with
   per-connection-group SLO and SLE such that the connectivity construct
   can inherit the SLO/SLE from the group if not explicitly defined.
   Additionally, in the case of hub and spoke connectivity, it may be
   inefficient when there are a large number of SDP with the multiple
   CCs.  As illustrated in Appendix B.3, "connectivity-type" of "vpn-
   common:hub-spoke" and "connection-group-sdp-role" of "vpn-common:hub-
   role" or "vpn-common:spoke-role" can be specified [RFC9181].

5.2.3.  IETF Network Slice Service SLO and SLE Policy

   As defined in section 5 of [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices], the
   SLO and SLE policy of the IETF Network Slice Services define some
   common attributes.

   "slo-sle-policy" is used to represent these SLO and SLE policies.
   During the creation of an IETF Network Slice Service, the policy can
   be specified either by a standard SLO and SLO template or a
   customized SLO and SLE policy.

   The policy can apply to per-network slice service, per-connection
   group "connection group", or per-connectivity construct
   "connectivity-construct".  Since there are multiple mechanisms for
   assigning a policy to a single connectivity construct, an override
   precedence order among them is as follows:

   *  Connectivity-construct at an individual sending SDP

   *  Connectivity-construct

   *  Connection-group

   *  Slice-level

   That is, the policy assigned through the sending SDP has highest
   precedence, and the policy assigned by the slice level has lowest
   precedence.  Therefore, the policy assigned through the sending SDP
   takes precedence over the policy assigned through the connection-
   construct entry.  Appendix B.5 gives an example of the preceding
   policy, which shows a slice service having an A2A connectivity as
   default and several specific SLO connections.

   The SLO attributes are as follows, including performance metric
   attributes, availability, and MTU.

   The list "metric-bound" supports the generic performance metric
   variations and the combinations and each "metric-bound" could specify
   a particular "metric-type". "metric-type" is defined with YANG
   identity and supports the following options:

      "one-way-bandwidth": Indicates the guaranteed minimum bandwidth
      between any two SDPs.  And the bandwidth is unidirectional.

      "two-way-bandwidth": Indicates the guaranteed minimum bandwidth
      between any two SDPs.  And the bandwidth is bidirectional.

      "one-way-delay-maximum": Indicates the maximum one-way latency

      between two SDPs.

      "two-way-delay-maximum": Indicates the maximum round-trip latency
      between two SDPs.

      "one-way-delay-percentile": Indicates the percentile objective of
      the one-way latency between two SDPs.

      "two-way-delay-percentile": Indicates the percentile objective of
      the round-trip latency between two SDPs.

      "one-way-delay-variation-maximum": Indicates the jitter constraint
      of the slice maximum permissible delay variation, and is measured
      by the difference in the one-way latency between sequential
      packets in a flow.

      "two-way-delay-variation-maximum": Indicates the jitter constraint
      of the slice maximum permissible delay variation, and is measured
      by the difference in the two-way latency between sequential
      packets in a flow.

      "one-way-delay-variation-percentile": Indicates the percentile
      objective of the delay variation, and is measured by the
      difference in the one-way latency between sequential packets in a
      flow.

      "two-way-delay-variation-percentile": Indicates the percentile
      objective of the delay variation, and is measured by the
      difference in the two-way latency between sequential packets in a
      flow.

      "one-way-packet-loss": Indicates maximum permissible packet loss
      rate, which is defined by the ratio of packets dropped to packets
      transmitted between two SDPs.

      "two-way-packet-loss": Indicates maximum permissible packet loss
      rate, which is defined by the ratio of packets dropped to packets
      transmitted between two SDPs.

   "availability": Specifies service availability defined as the ratio
   of uptime to the sum of uptime and downtime, where uptime is the time
   the IETF Network Slice is available in accordance with the SLOs
   associated with it.

   "mtu": Refers to the service MTU.  The service provider MUST support
   customer traffic using any PDU up to this size.

   The following common SLEs are defined:



Wu, et al.                Expires 25 April 2024                [Page 21]

Internet-Draft      Network Slice Service YANG Model        October 2023


      "security": The security leaf-list defines the list of security
      functions the customer requests the operator to apply to traffic
      between the two SDPs, including authentication, encryption, etc.

      "isolation": Specifies the isolation types that a customer
      expects.

      "max-occupancy-level": Specifies the number of flows that the
      operator admits.

      "steering-constraints": Specifies the constraints the customer
      requests the operator to route traffic for the IETF Network Slice
      Service.

   The following shows an example where a network slice policy can be
   configured:

   {
     "slice-services": {
       "slice-service": {
         "id": "exp-slice",
         "service-slo-sle-policy": {
           "description": "video-service-policy",
           "slo-policy": {
             "metric-bound": [
               {
                 "metric-type": "one-way-bandwidth",
                 "metric-unit": "Mbps",
                 "bound": "1000"
               },
               {
                 "metric-type": "two-way-delay-maximum",
                 "metric-unit": "milliseconds",
                 "bound": "10"
               }
             ],
             "availability": "ietf-nss:level-4",
             "mtu": "1500"
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }

   For more complex slicing scenarios, for example a multiple
   connectivity-construct slice service, an "override" option is
   provided to completely override all or part of the slo-sle template
   with new values.  For example, if a particular connection-group or a

Internet-Draft      Network Slice Service YANG Model        October 2023


   connectivity-construct has a unique bandwidth or latency setting,
   that are different from those defined in the slice service, a new set
   of SLOs/SLEs with full or partial override can be applied.  In the
   case of partial override, only the newly specified parameters are
   replaced from the original template, while maintaining on pre-
   existing parameters not specified.  While a full override removes all
   pre-existing parameters, and in essence starts a new set of SLOs/SLEs
   which are specified.  The "service-slo-sle-policy-override" is used
   to specify the requirements.

5.2.4.  IETF Network Slice Service Monitoring

   An IETF Network Slice Service defines connectivity with specific SLO
   characteristics, including bandwidth, latency, etc.  The connectivity
   is a combination of logical unidirectional connections, represented
   by "connectivity-construct".

   This model also describes operational and performance status of an
   IETF Network Slice.  The statistics are described in the following
   granularity:

   *  Per SDP: specified in "sdp-monitoring" under the "sdp".

   *  Per connectivity construct: specified in "connectivity-construct-
      monitoring" under the "connectivity-construct".

   *  Per connection group: specified in "connection-group-monitoring"
      under the "connection-group".

   This model does not define monitoring enabling methods.  The
   mechanism defined in [RFC8640] and [RFC8641] can be used for either
   periodic or on-demand subscription.

   By specifying subtree filters or xpath filters to "sdp",
   "connectivity-construct", or "connection-group", so that only
   interested contents will be sent.  These mechanisms can be used for
   monitoring the IETF Network Slice performance status so that the
   customer management system could initiate modification based on the
   IETF Network Slice running status.

5.2.5.  IETF Network Slice Service on Custom Topology

   The Slice Service customer might ask for some level of control over
   the topology or resources constraints. "custom-topology" is defined
   as an augmentation target that references the context topology.  The
   leaf "network-ref" under this container is used to reference a
   predefined topology as a customized topology constraint for an
   Network Slice Service.  As per Section 1 in [RFC8345] defines a

   general abstract topology concept to accommodate both the provider's
   resource capability and the customer's preferences.  The abstract
   topology is a topology that contains abstract topological elements
   (nodes, links, termination points).

   This document defines only the minimum attributes of the custom
   topology, which can be extended based on the implementation
   requirements.

   The following nodes are defined for the custom topology.

      "custom-topology": This container is served as an augmentation
      target for the Slice Service topology context, which can be
      multiple.  This node is located directly under the "Slice
      Services" list.

      "network-ref": This leaf is under the container "custom-topology",
      which is defined to reference a predefined topology as a
      customized topology constraint for an Network Slice Service, such
      as a VN topology to customize the service paths in a network slice
      by using type 2 Virtual Network (VN) defined in section 2.2 of
      [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-vn-yang] ,or an SAP topology to request SDP
      feasibility checks on a Service Attachment Points (SAPs) network
      topology described in Section 3 of [RFC9408].

      "tp-ref": A reference to Termination Point (TP) in the custom
      topology, under the list "sdp", can be used to associate an SDP
      with a TP of the customized topology.  The TPs can be access
      points of the VN topology or parent termination points of the SAP
      topology.

5.2.6.  IETF Network Slice Service Compute

   An IETF Network Slice Service is, by default, provisioned so that it
   can instantiated and deliver the service.  The IETF Network Slice
   Service customer may request to check the feasibility before
   instantiating a Network Slice Service.  In such a case, the IETF
   Network Slice Service is configured in "compute-only" mode to
   distinguish it from the default behavior.

   A "compute-only" Network Slice is configured as usual with the
   associated per slice SLOs/SLEs.  The NSC computes the feasible
   connectivity construct to the configured SLOs/SLEs.  This computation
   does not create the Network Slice or reserve any resources in the
   provider's network, it simply computes the resulting Network Slice
   based on the request.  The Network Slice "administrative-status" and
   the connection groups or connectivity construct list are used to
   convey the result.  For example, "admin-pre-deployment" can be used
   to show the status.

7.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this document is designed to be accessed
   via network management protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or
   RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport
   layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure
   Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the
   mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.

   o /ietf-network-slice-service/network-slice-services/slice-service

   The entries in the list above include the whole network
   configurations corresponding with the slice service which the higher
   management system requests, and indirectly create or modify the PE or
   P device configurations.  Unexpected changes to these entries could
   lead to service disruption and/or network misbehavior.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a URI in the IETF XML registry [RFC3688].
   Following the format in [RFC3688], the following registration is
   requested to be made:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-network-slice-service
      Registrant Contact: The IESG.
      XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document requests to register a YANG module in the YANG Module
   Names registry [RFC7950].

Appendix A.  Augmentation Considerations

   The NSSM defines the minimum attributes of slice services.  In some
   scenarios, further extension, e.g. the definition of AC technology
   specific attributes and the "isolation" SLE characteristics are
   required.

   For AC technology specific attributes, if the customer and provider
   need to agree, through configuration, on the technology parameter
   values, such as the protocol types and protocol parameters between
   the PE and the CE.  The following shows an example where BGP and
   static routing are augmented to the Network Slice Service model.  The
   protocol types and definitions can reference
   [I-D.boro-opsawg-teas-common-ac].

augment /ietf-nss:network-slice-services/ietf-nss:slice-service/ietf-nss:sdps\
  /ietf-nss:sdp/ietf-nss:sdp-peering/ietf-nss:protocols:
    +--rw bgp-attributes
    |  +--rw description?   string
    |  +--rw peer-as?       inet:as-number
    |  +--rw neighbor*      inet:ip-address
    +--rw static-attributes
       +--rw cascaded-lan-prefixes
          +--rw ip-lan-prefixes* [lan next-hop]
             +--rw lan         inet:ip-prefix
             +--rw next-hop    union
                   ...

   In some scenarios, for example, when multiple slice services share
   one or more ACs, independent AC services, defined in
   [I-D.boro-opsawg-teas-attachment-circuit], can be used.

   For "isolation" SLE characteristics, the following identities can be
   defined.

  identity service-interference-isolation-dedicated {
    base service-isolation-type;
    description
      "Specify the requirement that the slice service is not impacted
   by the existence of other customers or services in the same
   network, which may be provided by the service provider using
   dedicatd network resources, similar to a dedicated private network.";
  }


Appendix B.  Examples of Network Slice Services

B.1.  Example-1: Two A2A Slice Services with different match approaches

   The following example describes a simplified service configuration of
   two IETF Network slice instances where the SDPs are the customer-
   facing ports on the PE:

   *  IETF Network Slice 1 on SDP1, SDP11a, and SDP4, with an A2A
      connectivity type.  This is a L3 slice service and using the
      uniform low latency "slo-sle-template" policy between all SDPs.
      These SDPs will also have AC eBGP peering sessions with unmanaged
      CE elements (not shown) using an AC augmentation model such as the
      one shown above.

   *  IETF Network Slice 2 on SDP2, SDP11b, with A2A connectivity type.
      This is a L3 slice service and using the uniform high bandwidth
      "slo-sle-template" policy between all SDPs.

   Slice 1 uses the explicit match approach for mapping SDP traffic to a
   "connectivity-construct", while slice 2 uses the implicit approach.
   Both approaches are supported.

   Note: These two slices both use service-tags of "L3".  This "service-
   tag" is operator defined and has no specific meaning in the YANG
   model other to give a hint to the NSC on the service expectation
   being L3 forwarding.  In other examples we may choose to eliminate
   it.  The usage of this tag is arbitrary and up to the operator and
   the NSC on it's need and usage.

B.2.  Example-2: Two P2P slice services with different match approaches

   The following example describes a simplified service configuration of
   two IETF Network slice instances where the SDPs are the customer-
   facing ports on the PE:

   *  IETF Network Slice 3 on SDP5 and SDP7a with P2P connectivity type.
      This is a L2 slice service and using the uniform low-latency "slo-
      sle-template" policies between the SDPs.  A connectivity-group
      level slo-policy has been applied with a delay based metric bound
      of 10ms which will apply to both connectivity-constructs.

   *  IETF Network Slice 4 on SDP6 and SDP7b, with P2P connectivity
      type.  This is a L2 slice service and using the the high bandwidth
      "slo-sle-template" policies between the SDPs.  Traffic from SDP6
      and SDP7b is requesting a bandwidth of 1000Mbps, while in the
      reverse direction from SDP7b to SDP6, 5000Mbps is being requested.

   Slice 3 uses the explicit match approach for mapping SDP traffic to a
   "connectivity-group", while slice 2 uses the implicit approach.  Both
   approaches are supported.

   Note: These two slices both use service-tags of "L2".  This "service-
   tag" is operator defined and has no specific meaning in the YANG
   model other to give a hint to the NSC on the service expectation
   being L2 forwarding.  Other examples we may choose to eliminate it.
   The usage of this tag is arbitrary and up to the operator and the NSC
   on it's need and usage.

B.3.  Example-3: A Hub and Spoke Slice Service with a P2MP Connectivity
      Construct

   The following example describes a simplified service configuration of
   one IETF Network slice instance where the SDPs are the customer-
   facing ports on the PE:

      IETF Network Slice 5 is a hub-spoke slice with SDP14 as the hub
      and SDP11, SDP12, SDP13a, SDP13b as spokes.  This is a L3 slice
      service and using the uniform low-latency "slo-sle-template"
      policies between all spokes and the hub SDPs, but using an
      explicit set of SLO policies with a latency metric of 10ms for hub
      to spoke traffic.

B.4.  Example-4: An A2A Slice service with multiple SLOs and DSCP
      Matching

   The following example describes a simplified service configuration of
   an IETF Network slice instance where the SDPs are the customer-facing
   ports on the PE:


      IETF Network Slice 6 on SDP21, SDP23a, and SDP24, with A2A

      connectivity type.  This is a L3 slice service and using the
      uniform "standard" slo-sle-template policies between all SDPs.
      For traffic matching the DSCP of EF, a slo-sle-template policy of
      "low-latency" will be used.  The slice uses the explicit match
      approach for mapping SDP traffic to a connectivity construct.

B.5.  Example-5: An A2A Network Slice Service with SLO Precedence
      Policies

   The following examples describes a simplified service configuration
   of an IETF Network slice instance "slice-7" with four SDPs: SDP1,
   SDP2, SDP3 and SDP4 with A2A connectivity type.  All SDPs are
   designated as customer-facing ports on the PE.

   The service is realized using a single A2A connectivity construct,
   and a low-bandwidth "slo-sle-template" policy applied to SDP4 and
   SDP3, while a high-bandwidth "slo-sle-template" policy applied to
   SDP1 and SDP2.  Notice that the slo-sle-templates at the
   connecitivty- construct level take precedence to the one specified at
   the group level.

B.6.  Example-6: SDP at CE, L3 A2A Slice Service

   The following example describes a simplified service configuration of
   one IETF Network slice instances where the SDPs are located at the
   PE-facing ports on the CE:

   *  IETF Network Slice 8 with SDP31 on CE Device1, SDP33 (with two
      ACs) on Device 3 and SDP34 on Device 4, with an A2A connectivity
      type.  This is a L3 slice service and using the uniform low-
      latency slo-sle-template policy between all SDPs.

   *  This example also introduces the optional attribute of "sdp-ip".
      In this example it could be a loopback on the device.  How this
      sdp-ip is used by the NSC is out-of-scope here, but an example
      could be it is the management interface of the device.  The SDP
      and AC details are from the perspective of the CE in this example.
      How the CE ACs are mapped to the PE ACs are up to the NSC
      implementation and out-of-scope in this example.

B.7.  Example-7: SDP at CE, L3 A2A Slice Service with Network
      Abstraction

   The following example describes a simplified service configuration of
   one IETF Network slice instances where the SDPs are located at the
   PE-facing ports on the CE.

   In this example it is assumed that the NSC already has circuit
   binding details between the CE and PE which were previously assigned
   (method is out-of-scope) or the NSC has mechanisms to determine this
   mapping.  While the NSC capabilities are out-of-scope of this
   document, the NSC may use the CE device name, "sdp-id", "sdp-ip",
   "ac-id" or the "peer-sap-id" to complete this AC circuit binding.

   We are introducing the "peer-sap-id" in this example, which in this
   case, is an operator provided identifier that the slice requester can
   use for the NSC to identify the service attachment point (saps) in an
   abstracted way.  How the NSC uses the "peer-sap-id" is out of scope
   of this document, but a possible implementation would be that the NSC
   was previously provisioned with a "peer-sap-id" to PE
   device/interface/VLAN mapping table.  Alternatively, the NSC can
   request this mapping from an external database.

   *  IETF Network Slice 9 with SDP31 on CPE Device1, SDP33 (with two
      ACs) on Device 3 and SDP34 on Device 4, with an A2A connectivity
      type.  This is a L3 slice service and using the uniform low-
      latency slo-sle-template policy between all SDPs.

Appendix D.  Comparison with the Design Choice of ACTN VN Model
             Augmentation

   The difference between the ACTN VN model and the IETF Network Slice
   Service requirements is that the IETF Network Slice Service interface
   is a technology-agnostic interface, whereas the VN model is bound to
   the IETF TE Topologies.  The realization of the IETF Network Slice
   does not necessarily require the slice network to support the TE
   technology.

   The ACTN VN (Virtual Network) model introduced
   in[I-D.ietf-teas-actn-vn-yang] is the abstract customer view of the
   TE network.  Its YANG structure includes four components:

Internet-Draft      Network Slice Service YANG Model        October 2023


   *  VN: A Virtual Network (VN) is a network provided by a service
      provider to a customer for use and two types of VN has defined.
      The Type 1 VN can be seen as a set of edge-to-edge abstract links.
      Each link is an abstraction of the underlying network which can
      encompass edge points of the customer's network, access links,
      intra-domain paths, and inter-domain links.

   *  AP: An AP is a logical identifier used to identify the access link
      which is shared between the customer and the IETF scoped Network.

   *  VN-AP: A VN-AP is a logical binding between an AP and a given VN.

   *  VN-member: A VN-member is an abstract edge-to-edge link between
      any two APs or VN-APs.  Each link is formed as an E2E tunnel
      across the underlying networks.

   The Type 1 VN can be used to describe IETF Network Slice connection
   requirements.  However, the Network Slice SLO and Network Slice SDP
   are not clearly defined and there's no direct equivalent.  For
   example, the SLO requirement of the VN is defined through the IETF TE
   Topologies YANG model, but the TE Topologies model is related to a
   specific implementation technology.  Also, VN-AP does not define
   "service-match-criteria" to specify a specific SDP belonging to an
   IETF Network Slice Service.
