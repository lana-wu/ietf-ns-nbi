Internet-Draft      Network Slice Service YANG Model       February 2024


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG [RFC7950] data model for
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices] Network Slice Service.
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices] discusses common framework and
   interface for Network Slice using IETF technologies.  The Network
   Slice Services may be referred to as RFC AAAA Network Slice Services.
   In this document, we simply use the term "Network Slice Service" to
   refer to this concept.

   The Network Slice Service Model (NSSM) can be used in the Network
   Slice Service Interface exposed by a provider to its customers
   (including of provider's internal use) in order to manage (e.g.,
   subscribe, delete, or change) Network Slice Services.  The agreed
   service will then trigger the appropriate Network Slice operation,
   such as instantiating, modifying, or deleting a Network Slice.

   The NSSM focuses on the requirements of a Network Slice Service from
   the point of view of the customer, not how it is implemented within a
   provider network.  The module is classified as customer service model
   (Section 2 of [RFC8309]).  As discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices], the mapping between a Network
   Slice Service and its realization is implementation and deployment
   specific.

   The NSSM conforms to the Network Management Datastore Architecture
   (NMDA) [RFC8342].

   Editorial Note: (To be removed by RFC Editor)

   This document contains several placeholder values that need to be
   replaced with finalized values at the time of publication.  Please
   apply the following replacements:

   *  "AAAA" -- the assigned RFC value for
      [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices].

   *  "DDDD" -- the assigned RFC value for this draft both in this draft
      and in the YANG models under the revision statement.

   *  The "revision" date in model, in the format XXXX-XX-XX, needs to
      be updated with the date the draft gets approved.

3.  Network Slice Service Overview

   As defined in Section 3.2 of [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices], a
   Network Slice Service is specified in terms of a set of Service
   Demarcation Points (SDPs), a set of one or more connectivity
   constructs between subsets of these SDPs, and a set of Service Level
   Objectives (SLOs) and Service Level Expectations (SLEs) for each SDP
   sending to each connectivity construct.  A communication type (point-
   to-point (P2P), point-to-multipoint (P2MP), or any-to-any (A2A)) is
   specified for each connectivity construct.

   The SDPs serve as the Network Slice Service ingress/egress points.
   An SDP is identified by a unique identifier in the context of a
   Network Slice Service.

   Examples of Network Slice Services that contain only one connectivity
   construct are shown in Figure 1.

                                 Constructs

   As shown in Figure 2, the Network Slice Service 4 contains two P2P
   connectivity constructs between the set of SDPs.  The Network Slice
   Service 5 is a bidirectional unicast service between SDP14 and SDP15
   that consists of two unidirectional P2P connectivity constructs.

4.  Network Slice Service Model (NSSM) Usage

   The NSSM can be used by a provider to expose its Network Slice
   Services, and by a customer to manage its Network Slices Services
   (e.g., request, delete, or modify).  The details about how service
   requests are handled by the provider (specifically, a controller),
   including which network operations are triggered, are internal to the
   provider.  The details of the Network Slices realization are hidden
   from customers.

   The Network Slices are applicable to use cases, such as (but not
   limited to) 5G, network wholesale services, network infrastructure
   sharing among operators, Network Function Virtualization (NFV)
   connectivity, and Data Center interconnect.
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-use-cases] provides a more detailed
   description of the usecases for Network Slices.

Internet-Draft      Network Slice Service YANG Model       February 2024


   An Network Slice Controller (NSC) is an entity that exposes the
   Network Slice Service Interface to customers to manage Network Slice
   Services.  Typically, an NSC receives requests from its customer-
   facing interface (e.g., from a management system).  During service
   creation, this interface can convey data objects that the Network
   Slice Service customer provides, describing the needed Network Slices
   Service in terms of SDPs, the associated connectivity constructs, and
   the service objectives that the customer wishes to be fulfilled.
   Depending of whether the requirements and authorization checks are
   met, these service requirements are then translated into technology-
   specific actions that are implemented in the underlying network using
   a network-facing interface.  The details of how the Network Slices
   are put into effect are out of scope for this document.

   As shown in Figure 3, the NSSM is used by the customer's higher level
   operation system to communicate with an NSC for life cycle management
   of Network Slices including both enablement and monitoring.  For
   example, in the 5G End-to-end network slicing use-case the 5G network
   slice orchestrator acts as the higher layer system to manage the
   Network Slice Services.  The interface is used to support dynamic
   Network Slice management to facilitate end-to-end 5G network slice
   services.

           Figure 3: Network Slice Service Reference Architecture

   Note: The NSSM can be used recursively (hierarchical mode), i.e., an
   NSS can map to child NSSes.  As described in Section A.5 of
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices], the Network Slice Service can
   support a recursive composite architecture that allows one layer of
   Network Slice Services to be used by other layers.

5.  Network Slice Service Model (NSSM) Description

   The NSSM, "ietf-network-slice-service", includes two main data nodes:
   "slo-sle-templates" and "slice-service" (see Figure 4).

Internet-Draft      Network Slice Service YANG Model       February 2024


   The "slo-sle-templates" container is used by an NSC to maintain a set
   of common network slice SLO and SLE templates that apply to one or
   several Network Slice Services.  Refer to Section 5.1 for further
   details on the properties of a NSS templates.

   The "slice-service" list includes the set of Network Slice Services
   that are maintained by a provider. "slice-service" is the data
   structure that abstracts the Network Slice Service.  Under the
   "slice-service", the "sdp" list is used to abstract the SDPs.  The
   "connection-group" is used to abstract connectivity constructs
   between SDPs.  Refer to Section 5.2 for further details on the
   properties of a NSS.

   Figure 4 describes the overall tree structure of the NSSM.

5.1.  SLO and SLE Templates

   The "slo-sle-templates" container (Figure 5) is used by a Network
   Slice Service provider to define and maintain a set of common Network
   Slice Service templates that apply to one or several Network Slice
   Services.  The templates are assumed to be known to both the
   customers and the provider.  The exact definition of the templates is
   deployment specific to each provider.

   The NSSM provides the identifiers of SLO and SLE templates and the
   common attributes defined in Section 5.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices].  Considering that there are many
   attributes defined and some attributes could vary with service
   requirements, e.g., bandwidth, or latency, standard templates as well
   as custom "service-slo-sle-policy" are defined.  Customer can choose
   either a standard template provided by the operator or a custom
   "service-slo-sle-policy".

   1.  Standard template: The exact definition of the templates is
       deployment specific to the provider.  The attributes
       configuration of a standard template is optional.  When
       specifying attributes, a standard template can use "template-ref"
       to inherit some attributes of the predefined standard template
       and override the specific attributes.

   2.  Custom "service-slo-sle-policy": More description is provided in
       Section 5.2.3.

   Figure 6 shows an example where two standard network slice templates
   can be retrieved by the customers.

5.2.  Network Slice Services

   The "slice-service" is the data structure that abstracts a Network
   Slice Service.  Each "slice-service" is uniquely identified by "id"
   specified in the context of an NSC.

   A Network Slice Service has the following main data nodes:

   *  "description": Provides a textual description of an Network Slice
      Service.

   *  "service-tags": Indicates a management tag (e.g., "customer-name"
      ) that is used to correlate the operational information of
      Customer Higher-level Operation System and Network Slices.  It
      might be used by a Network Slice Service provider to provide
      additional information to an NSC during the operation of the
      Network Slices.  E.g. adding tags with "customer-name" when
      multiple actual customers use a same Network Slice Service.
      Another use-case for "service-tag" might be for a provider to
      provide additional attributes to an NSC which might be used during
      the realization of Network Slice Services such as type of services
      (e.g., Layer 2 or Layer 3 technology).  These additional
      attributes can also be used by an NSC for various purposes such as
      monitoring and assurance of the Network Slice Services where the
      NSC can issue notifications to the customer system.  Note that all
      these attributes are optional.

   *  "slo-sle-policy": Defines SLO and SLE policies for the "slice-
      service".  More details are provided in Section 5.2.3.

   *  "compute-only": Is used to check the feasibility before
      instantiating a Network Slice Service.  More details are provided
      in Section 5.2.6.

   *  "status": Is used to show the both operational and administrative
      status of a Network Slice Service.  It can be used as indicator to
      detect Network Slice Service anomalies.

   *  "sdps": Represents a set of SDPs that are involved in the Network
      Slice Service.  More details are provided in Section 5.2.1.

   *  "connection-groups": Abstracts the connections to the set of SDPs
      of the Network Slice Service.

   *  "custom-topology": Represents custom topology constraints for the
      Network Slice Service.  More details are provided in Section 5.2.5

                     Figure 7: "sdps" Subtree Structure

   Section 5.2 of [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices] describes four
   possible ways in which an SDP may be placed:

   *  Within the CE

   *  Provider-facing ports on the CE

   *  Customer-facing ports on the PE

   *  Within the PE

   Although there are four options, they can be categorized into two:
   CE-based or PE-based.





Wu, et al.               Expires 20 August 2024                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft      Network Slice Service YANG Model       February 2024


   In the four options, the Attachment Circuit (AC) may be part of the
   Network Slice Service or may be external to it.  Based on the AC
   definition in Section 5.2 of [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices], the
   customer and provider may agree on a per {Network Slice Service,
   connectivity construct, and SLOs/SLEs} basis to police or shape
   traffic on the AC in both the ingress (CE to PE) direction and egress
   (PE to CE) direction, which ensures that the traffic is within the
   capacity profile that is agreed in a Network Slice Service.  Excess
   traffic is dropped by default, unless specific out-of-profile
   policies are agreed between the customer and the provider.

   To abstract the SDP options and SLOs/SLEs profiles, an SDP has the
   following characteristics:

   *  "id": Uniquely identifies the SDP within an NSC.  The identifier
      is a string that allows any encoding for the local administration
      of the Network Slice Service.

   *  "geo-location": Indicates SDP location information, which helps
      the NSC to identify an SDP.

   *  "node-id": A reference to the node that hosts the SDP, which helps
      the NSC to identify an SDP.  This document assumes that higher-
      level systems can obtain the node information, PE and CE, prior to
      the service requests.  For example, SAP Network [RFC9408] can
      obtain PE-related node information.  The implementation details
      are left to the NSC provider.

   *  "sdp-ip-address": The SDP IP information, which helps the NSC to
      identify an SDP.

   *  "tp-ref": A reference to a Termination Point (TP) in the custom
      topology defined in Section 5.2.5.

   *  "service-match-criteria": Defines matching policies for the
      Network Slice Service traffic to apply on a given SDP.

   *  "incoming-qos-policy" and "outgoing-qos-policy": Sets the incoming
      and outgoing QoS policies to apply on a given SDP, including QoS
      policy and specific ingress and egress traffic limits to ensure
      access security.  When applied in the incoming direction, the
      policy is applicable to the traffic that passes through the AC
      from the customer network or from another provider's network to
      the Network Slice.  When applied in the outgoing direction, the
      policy is applied to the traffic from the Network Slice towards
      the customer network or towards another provider's network.  If an
      SDP has multiple ACs, the "rate-limits" of "attachment-circuit"
      can be set to an AC specific value, but the rate cannot exceed the

Internet-Draft      Network Slice Service YANG Model       February 2024


      "rate-limits" of the SDP.  If an SDP only contains a single AC,
      then the "rate-limits" of "attachment-circuit" is the same with
      the SDP.  The definition of AC refers to Section 5.2
      [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices].

   *  "sdp-peering": Specifies the peers and peering protocols for an
      SDP to exchange control-plane information, e.g.  Layer 1 signaling
      protocol or Layer 3 routing protocols, etc.  As shown in Figure 8

      +--rw sdp-peering
      |  +--rw peer-sap-id*   string
      |  +--rw protocols

                  Figure 8: "sdp-peering" Subtree Structure

      -  "peer-sap-id": Indicates the references to the remote endpoints
         of attachment circuits.  This information can be used for
         correlation purposes, such as identifying Service Attachment
         Points (SAPs) defined in [RFC9408], which defines a model of an
         abstract view of the provider network topology that contains
         the points from which the services can be attached.

      -  "protocols": Serves as an augmentation target.  Appendix A
         gives the example protocols of BGP, static routing, etc.

   *  "ac-svc-name": Indicates the names of AC services, for association
      purposes, to refer to the ACs that have been created.  When both
      "ac-svc-name" and the attributes of "attachment-circuits" are
      defined, the "ac-svc-name" takes precedence.

   *  "ce-mode": A flag node that marks the SDP as CE type.

   *  "attachment-circuits": Specifies the list of ACs by which the
      service traffic is received.  This is an optional SDP attribute.
      When an SDP has multiple ACs and some AC specific attributes are
      needed, each "attachment-circuit" can specify attributes, such as
      interface specific IP addresses, service MTU, etc.

   *  "status": Enables the control of the administrative status and
      report the operational status of the SDP.  These status values can
      be used as indicator to detect SDP anomalies.

   *  "sdp-monitoring": Provides SDP bandwidth statistics.

   Depending on the requirements of different cases, "service-match-
   criteria" can be used for the following purposes:

   *  Specify the AC type: physical or logical connection

Internet-Draft      Network Slice Service YANG Model       February 2024


   *  Distinguish the SDP traffic if the SDP is located in the CE or PE

   *  Distinguish the traffic of different connection groups (CGs) or
      connectivity constructs (CCs) when multiple CGs/CCs of different
      SLO/SLE may be set up between the same pair of SDPs, as
      illustrated in Figure 9.  Traffic needs to be explicitly mapped
      into the Network Slice's specific connectivity construct.  The
      policies, "service-match-criteria", are based on the values in
      which combination of layer 2 and layer 3 header and payload fields
      within a packet to identify to which {Network Slice Service,
      connectivity construct, and SLOs/SLEs} that packet is assigned.

   *  Define specific out-of-profile policies: The customer may choose
      to use an explicit "service-match-criteria" to map any SDP's
      traffic or a subset of the SDP's traffic to a specific connection
      group or connectivity construct.  If a subset of traffic is
      matched (e.g. dscp-match) and mapped to a connectivity construct,
      the customer may choose to add a subsequent "match-any" to
      explicitly map the remaining SDP traffic to a separate
      connectivity construct.  If the customer chooses to implicitly map
      remaining traffic and if there are no additional connectivity
      constructs where the "sdp-id" source is specified, then that
      traffic will be dropped.

   If an SDP is placed at the port of a CE or PE, and there is only one
   single connectivity construct with a source at the SDP, traffic can
   be implicitly mapped to this connectivity construct since the AC
   information (e.g., VLAN tag) can be used to unambiguously identify
   the traffic and the SDP is the only source of the connectivity-
   construct.  Appendix B.1 shows an example of both the implicit and
   explicit approaches.  While explicit matching is optional in some use
   cases, it provides a more clear and readable implementation, but the
   choice is left to the operator.

   To illustrate the use of SDP options, Figure 10 and Figure 11 are two
   examples.  How an NSC realize the mapping is out of scope for this
   document.

*  SDPs at customer-facing ports on the PEs: As shown in Figure 10 ,
   a customer of the Network Slice Service would like to connect two
   SDPs to satisfy specific service needs, e.g., network wholesale
   services.  In this case, the Network Slice SDPs are mapped to
   customer-facing ports of PE nodes.  The NSC uses "node-id" (PE
   device ID), "attachment-circuits" (ACs) or "ac-svc-name" to map
   SDPs to the customer-facing ports on the PEs.

5.2.2.  Connectivity Constructs

   Section 4.2.1 of [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices] defines the
   basic connectivity construct (CC) and CC types of a Network Slice
   Service, including P2P, P2MP, and A2A.

   A Network Slice Service involves one or more connectivity constructs.
   The "connection-groups" container is used to abstract CC, CC groups,
   and their SLO-SLE policies and the structure is shown in Figure 12.

              Figure 12: "connection-groups" Subtree Structure

   The description of the "connection-groups" data nodes is as follows:

   *  "connection-group": Represents a group of CCs.  In the case of hub
      and spoke connectivity of the Slice Service, it may be inefficient
      when there are a large number of SDPs with the multiple CCs.  As
      illustrated in Appendix B.3, "connectivity-type" of "ietf-vpn-
      common:hub-spoke" and "connection-group-sdp-role" of "ietf-vpn-
      common:hub-role" or "ietf-vpn-common:spoke-role" can be specified
      [RFC9181].  Another use is for optimizing "slo-sle-policy"
      configurations, treating CCs with the same SLO and SLE
      characteristics as a connection group such that the connectivity
      construct can inherit the SLO/SLE from the group if not explicitly
      defined.

   *  "connectivity-type": Indicates the type of the connection group,
      extending "vpn-common:vpn-topology" specified [RFC9181] with the
      NS connectivity type, e.g., P2P and P2MP.

   *  "connectivity-construct": Represents single connectivity
      construct, and "slo-sle-policy" under it represents the per-
      connectivity construct SLO and SLE requirements.

Internet-Draft      Network Slice Service YANG Model       February 2024


   *  "slo-sle-policy" and "service-slo-sle-policy-override": The
      details of "slo-sle-policy" is defined in Section 5.2.3.  In
      addition to "slo-sle-policy" nodes of "connection-group" and
      "connectivity-construct", a leaf node "service-slo-sle-policy-
      override" is provided for scenarios with complex SLO-SLE
      requirements to completely override all or part of an "slo-sle-
      policy" with new values.  For example, if a particular
      "connection-group" or a "connectivity-construct" has a unique
      bandwidth or latency setting, that are different from those
      defined in the Slice Service, a new set of SLOs/SLEs with full or
      partial override can be applied.  In the case of partial override,
      only the newly specified parameters are replaced from the original
      template, while maintaining on pre-existing parameters not
      specified.  While a full override removes all pre-existing
      parameters, and in essence starts a new set of SLOs/SLEs which are
      specified.

5.2.3.  SLO and SLE Policy

   As defined in Section 5 of [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices], the
   SLO and SLE policy of the Network Slice Services define some common
   attributes.

   "slo-sle-policy" is used to represent these SLO and SLE policies.
   During the creation of a Network Slice Service, the policy can be
   specified either by a standard SLO and SLE template or a customized
   SLO and SLE policy.

   The policy can apply to per-network Slice Service, per-connection
   group "connection group", or per-connectivity construct
   "connectivity-construct".  Since there are multiple mechanisms for
   assigning a policy to a single connectivity construct, an override
   precedence order among them is as follows:

   *  Connectivity-construct at an individual sending SDP

   *  Connectivity-construct

   *  Connection-group

   *  Slice-level

   That is, the policy assigned through the sending SDP has highest
   precedence, and the policy assigned by the slice level has lowest
   precedence.  Therefore, the policy assigned through the sending SDP
   takes precedence over the policy assigned through the connection-
   construct entry.  Appendix B.5 gives an example of the preceding
   policy, which shows a Slice Service having an A2A connectivity as
   default and several specific SLO connections.

   The SLO attributes include performance metric attributes,
   availability, and MTU.  The SLO structure is shown in Figure 13.

   The list "metric-bound" supports the generic performance metric
   variations and the combinations and each "metric-bound" could specify
   a particular "metric-type". "metric-type" is defined with YANG
   identity and supports the following options:

      "one-way-bandwidth": Indicates the guaranteed minimum bandwidth
      between any two SDPs.  And the bandwidth is unidirectional.

      "two-way-bandwidth": Indicates the guaranteed minimum bandwidth
      between any two SDPs.  And the bandwidth is bidirectional.

      "one-way-delay-maximum": Indicates the maximum one-way latency
      between two SDPs, defined in [RFC7679].

      "two-way-delay-maximum": Indicates the maximum round-trip latency
      between two SDPs, defined in [RFC2681].  .

      "one-way-delay-percentile": Indicates the percentile objective of
      the one-way latency between two SDPs (See [RFC7679]).

      "two-way-delay-percentile": Indicates the percentile objective of
      the round-trip latency between two SDPs (See [RFC2681])..

      "one-way-delay-variation-maximum": Indicates the jitter constraint
      of the slice maximum permissible delay variation, and is measured
      by the difference in the one-way latency between sequential
      packets in a flow, as defined in [RFC3393]

      "two-way-delay-variation-maximum": Indicates the jitter constraint
      of the slice maximum permissible delay variation, and is measured
      by the difference in the two-way latency between sequential
      packets in a flow, as defined in [RFC3393].

      "one-way-delay-variation-percentile": Indicates the percentile
      objective of the delay variation, and is measured by the
      difference in the one-way latency between sequential packets in a
      flow, as defined in [RFC3393].

      "two-way-delay-variation-percentile": Indicates the percentile
      objective of the delay variation, and is measured by the
      difference in the two-way latency between sequential packets in a
      flow, as defined in [RFC5481].

      "one-way-packet-loss": Indicates maximum permissible packet loss
      rate (See [RFC7680], which is defined by the ratio of packets
      dropped to packets transmitted between two SDPs.

      "two-way-packet-loss": Indicates maximum permissible packet loss
      rate (See [RFC7680], which is defined by the ratio of packets
      dropped to packets transmitted between two SDPs.

   "availability": Specifies service availability defined as the ratio
   of uptime to the sum of uptime and downtime, where uptime is the time
   the Network Slice is available in accordance with the SLOs associated
   with it.

   "mtu": Refers to the service MTU.  If the customer sends packets that
   are longer than the requested service MTU, the network may discard it
   (or for IPv4, fragment it).  Depending on the service layer, the
   value can be an L3 service MTU (Section 7.6.6 [RFC9182]) or an L2
   service MTU (Section 7.4 [RFC9291] ).

   As shown in Figure 14, the following SLEs data nodes are defined.

      "security": The security leaf-list defines the list of security
      functions the customer requests the operator to apply to traffic
      between the two SDPs, including authentication, encryption, etc,
      which is defined in Section 5.1.2.1
      [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices].

      "isolation": Specifies the isolation types that a customer

      [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices].

      "max-occupancy-level": Specifies the number of flows that the
      operator admits (See Section 5.1.2.1
      [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices]).

      "steering-constraints": Specifies the constraints the customer
      requests the operator to steer traffic for the Network Slice
      Service, which is defined as geographic restrictions in
      Section 5.1.2.1 [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices].

5.2.4.  Network Slice Service Performance Monitoring

   The operation and performance status of Network Slice Services is
   also a key component of the NSSM.  The model provides SLO monitoring
   information with the following granularity:

   *  Per SDP: The incoming and outgoing bandwidths of an SDP are
      specified in "sdp-monitoring" under the "sdp".

   *  Per connectivity construct: The delay, delay variation, and packet
      loss status are specified in "connectivity-construct-monitoring"
      under the "connectivity-construct".

   *  Per connection group: The delay, delay variation, and packet loss
      status are specified in "connection-group-monitoring" under the
      "connection-group".

Internet-Draft      Network Slice Service YANG Model       February 2024


   [RFC8639] and [RFC8641] define a subscription mechanism and a push
   mechanism for YANG datastores.  These mechanisms currently allow the
   user to subscribe to notifications on a per-client basis and specify
   either periodic or on-demand notifications.  By specifying subtree
   filters or xpath filters to "sdp", "connectivity-construct", or
   "connection-group", so that only interested contents will be sent.
   The example in Figure 24 shows the way for a customer to subscribe to
   the monitoring information for a particular Network Slice Service. .

   Additionaly, a customer can use the NSSM to obtain a snapshot of the
   Network Slice Service performance status through [RFC8040] or
   [RFC6241] interfaces.  For example, retrieve the per-connectivity-
   construc data by specifying "connectivity-construct" as the filter in
   the RESTCONF GET request.

5.2.5.  Custom Topology Constraints

   The Slice Service customer might request for some level of control
   over the topology or resources constraints.  "custom-topology" is
   defined as an augmentation target that references the context
   topology.  The leaf "network-ref" under this container is used to
   reference a predefined topology as a customized topology constraint
   for an Network Slice Service.  Section 1 of [RFC8345] defines a
   general abstract topology concept to accommodate both the provider's
   resource capability and the customer's preferences.  The abstract
   topology is a topology that contains abstract topological elements
   (nodes, links, and termination points).

   This document defines only the minimum attributes of a custom
   topology, which can be extended based on the implementation
   requirements.

   The following nodes are defined for the custom topology:

      "custom-topology": This container serves as an augmentation target
      for the Slice Service topology context, which can be multiple.
      This node is located directly under the "slice-service" list.

      "network-ref": This leaf is under the container "custom-topology",
      which is defined to reference a predefined topology as a
      customized topology constraint for a Network Slice Service, e.g.,
      a Service Attachment Points (SAPs) topology to request SDP
      feasibility checks on a SAPs network described in Section 3 of
      [RFC9408], an abstract Traffic Engineering (TE) topology defined
      in section-3.13 of [RFC8795] to customize the service paths in a
      Network Slice Service.

      "tp-ref": A reference to Termination Point (TP) in the custom

Internet-Draft      Network Slice Service YANG Model       February 2024


      topology, under the list "sdp", can be used to associate an SDP
      with a TP of the customized topology.  The example TPs could be
      parent termination points of the SAP topology.

5.2.6.  Network Slice Service Compute

   A Network Slice Service is, by default, provisioned so that it can
   instantiate and trigger service delivery.  A Network Slice Service
   customer may request to check the feasibility of a request before
   instantiating or modifying a Network Slice Service . In such a case,
   the Network Slice Service is configured in "compute-only" mode to
   distinguish it from the default behavior.

   A "compute-only" Network Slice Service is configured as usual with
   the associated per slice SLOs/SLEs.  The NSC computes the feasible
   connectivity constructs to the configured SLOs/SLEs.  This
   computation does not create the Network Slice or reserve any
   resources in the provider's network, it simply computes the resulting
   Network Slice based on the request.  The Network Slice "admin-status"
   and the connection groups or connectivity construct list are used to
   convey the result.  For example, "admin-compute-only" can be used to
   show the status.  Customers can query the "compute-only" connectivity
   constructs attributes, or can subscribe to be notified when the
   connectivity constructs status change.

   The "compute-only" applies only if the data model is used with a
   protocol that does not natively support such operation, e.g.
   [RFC8040].  When using NETCONF, <edit-config> operation (Section 7.2
   of [RFC6241]), "test-only" of the <test-option> parameter also
   applies.

                Figure 17: Network Slice Service YANG Module


7.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in these YANG modules that
   are writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   and delete operations to these data nodes without proper protection
   or authentication can have a negative effect on network operations.
   These are the subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/
   vulnerability in the "ietf-network-slice-service" module:

   * /ietf-network-slice-service/network-slice-services/slo-sle-
   templates

   This subtree specifies the Network Slice Service SLO templates and
   SLE templates.  Modifying the configuration in the subtree will
   change the related Network Slice Service configuration in the future.
   By making such modifications, a malicious attacker may degrade the
   Slice Service functions configured at a certain time in the future.

Internet-Draft      Network Slice Service YANG Model       February 2024


   * /ietf-network-slice-service/network-slice-services/slice-service

   The entries in the list above include the whole network
   configurations corresponding with the Network Slice Service which the
   higher management system requests, and indirectly create or modify
   the PE or P device configurations.  Unexpected changes to these
   entries could lead to service disruption and/or network misbehavior.

   Some of the readable data nodes in these YANG modules may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It
   is thus important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config,
   or notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and
   data nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability in the "ietf-network-
   slice-service" module:

   * /ietf-network-slice-service/network-slice-services/slo-sle-
   templates

   Unauthorized access to the subtree may disclose the SLO and SLE
   templates of the Network Slice Service.

   * /ietf-network-slice-service/network-slice-services/slice-service

   Unauthorized access to the subtree may disclose the operation status
   information of the Network Slice Service.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document request to register the following URI in the IETF XML
   registry [RFC3688]:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-network-slice-service
      Registrant Contact: The IESG.
      XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document requests to register the following YANG module in the
   YANG Module Names registry [RFC7950].

           Name: ietf-network-slice-service
           Namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-network-slice-service
           Prefix: ietf-nss
           Maintained by IANA: N
           Reference: RFC DDDD

Appendix A.  Augmentation Considerations

   The NSSM defines the minimum attributes of Slice Services.  In some
   scenarios, further extension, e.g. the definition of AC technology
   specific attributes and the "isolation" SLE characteristics are
   required.

   For AC technology specific attributes, if the customer and provider
   need to agree, through configuration, on the technology parameter
   values, such as the protocol types and protocol parameters between
   the PE and the CE.  The following shows an example where BGP and
   static routing are augmented to the Network Slice Service model.  The
   protocol types and definitions can reference
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-teas-common-ac].

       Figure 18: Example YANG Tree Augmenting SDP Peering Protocols

   In some scenarios, for example, when multiple Slice Services share
   one or more ACs, independent AC services, defined in
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-teas-attachment-circuit], can be used.

   For "isolation" SLE characteristics, the following identities can be
   defined.

     identity service-interference-isolation-dedicated {
       base service-isolation-type;
       description
         "Specify the requirement that the Slice Service is not impacted
          by the existence of other customers or services in the same
          network, which may be provided by the service provider using
          dedicated network resources, similar to a dedicated
          private network.";

Appendix B.  Examples of Network Slice Services

B.1.  Example-1: Two A2A Slice Services with Different Match Approaches

   Figure 20 shows an example of two Network Slice Service instances
   where the SDPs are the customer-facing ports on the PE:

   *  Network Slice 1 on SDP1, SDP11a, and SDP4, with an A2A
      connectivity type.  This is a L3 Slice Service and using the
      uniform low latency "slo-sle-template" policy between all SDPs.
      These SDPs will also have AC eBGP peering sessions with unmanaged
      CE elements (not shown) using an AC augmentation model such as the
      one shown above.

   *  Network Slice 2 on SDP2, SDP11b, with A2A connectivity type.  This
      is a L3 Slice Service and using the uniform high bandwidth "slo-
      sle-template" policy between all SDPs.

   Slice 1 uses the explicit match approach for mapping SDP traffic to a
   "connectivity-construct", while slice 2 uses the implicit approach.
   Both approaches are supported.  The "slo-sle-templates" templates are
   known to the customer.

   Note: These two slices both use service-tags of "L3".  This "service-
   tag" is operator defined and has no specific meaning in the YANG
   model other to give a hint to the NSC on the service expectation
   being L3 forwarding.  In other examples we may choose to eliminate
   it.  The usage of this tag is arbitrary and up to the operator and
   the NSC on it's need and usage.

  Figure 21: Example of a Message Body to Create Two A2A Slice Services

B.2.  Example-2: Two P2P Slice Services with Different Match Approaches

   Figure 22 shows an example of two Network Slice Service instances
   where the SDPs are the customer-facing ports on the PE:

   *  Network Slice 3 on SDP5 and SDP7a with P2P connectivity type.
      This is a L2 Slice Service and using the uniform low-latency "slo-
      sle-template" policies between the SDPs.  A connectivity-group
      level slo-policy has been applied with a delay-based metric bound
      of 10ms which will apply to both connectivity-constructs.

Internet-Draft      Network Slice Service YANG Model       February 2024


   *  Network Slice 4 on SDP6 and SDP7b, with P2P connectivity type.
      This is a L2 Slice Service and using the high bandwidth "slo-sle-
      template" policies between the SDPs.  Traffic from SDP6 and SDP7b
      is requesting a bandwidth of 1000Mbps, while in the reverse
      direction from SDP7b to SDP6, 5000Mbps is being requested.

   Slice 3 uses the explicit match approach for mapping SDP traffic to a
   "connectivity-group", while slice 2 uses the implicit approach.  Both
   approaches are supported.

   Note: These two slices both use service-tags of "L2".  This "service-
   tag" is operator defined and has no specific meaning in the YANG
   model other to give a hint to the NSC on the service expectation
   being L2 forwarding.  Other examples we may choose to eliminate it.
   The usage of this tag is arbitrary and up to the operator and the NSC
   on it's need and usage.

  Figure 23: Example of a Message Body to Create Two P2P Slice Services

   The example shown in Figure 24 illustrates how a customer subscribes
   to the monitoring information of "slice3".  The customer is
   interested in is the operational and performance status of SDPs and
   connectivity constructs.

B.3.  Example-3: A Hub and Spoke Slice Service with a P2MP Connectivity
      Construct

   Figure 26 shows an example of one Network Slice Service instance
   where the SDPs are the customer-facing ports on the PE:

      Network Slice 5 is a hub-spoke slice with SDP14 as the hub and
      SDP11, SDP12, SDP13a, SDP13b as spokes.  This is a L3 Slice
      Service and using the uniform low-latency "slo-sle-template"
      policies between all spokes and the hub SDPs, but using an
      explicit set of SLO policies with a latency metric of 10ms for hub
      to spoke traffic.

B.4.  Example-4: An A2A Slice Service with Multiple SLOs and DSCP
      Matching

   Figure 28 shows an example of a Network slice instance where the SDPs
   are the customer-facing ports on the PE:

      Network Slice 6 on SDP21, SDP23a, and SDP24, with A2A connectivity
      type.  This is a L3 Slice Service and using the uniform "standard"
      slo-sle-template policies between all SDPs.  For traffic matching
      the DSCP of EF, a slo-sle-template policy of "low-latency" will be
      used.  The slice uses the explicit match approach for mapping SDP
      traffic to a connectivity construct.

                        Service with DSCP Matching

B.5.  Example-5: An A2A Network Slice Service with SLO Precedence
      Policies

   Figure 30 shows an example of a Network slice instance "slice-7" with
   four SDPs: SDP1, SDP2, SDP3 and SDP4 with A2A connectivity type.  All
   SDPs are designated as customer-facing ports on the PE.

   The service is realized using a single A2A connectivity construct,
   and a low-bandwidth "slo-sle-template" policy applied to SDP4 and
   SDP3, while a high-bandwidth "slo-sle-template" policy applied to
   SDP1 and SDP2.  Notice that the "slo-sle-templates" at the
   connecitivty construct level takes precedence over the one specified
   at the group level.

        Figure 31: Example of a Message Body to Create an A2A Slice
                        Service with SLO Precedence

B.6.  Example-6: SDP at CE, L3 A2A Slice Service

   Figure 32 shows an example of one Network slice instance where the
   SDPs are located at the PE-facing ports on the CE:

   *  Network Slice 8 with SDP31 on CE Device1, SDP33 (with two ACs) on
      Device 3 and SDP34 on Device 4, with an A2A connectivity type.
      This is a L3 Slice Service and using the uniform low-latency slo-
      sle-template policy between all SDPs.

   *  This example also introduces the optional attribute of "sdp-ip".
      In this example it could be a loopback on the device.  How this
      "sdp-ip" is used by the NSC is out-of-scope here, but an example
      could be it is the management interface of the device.  The SDP
      and AC details are from the perspective of the CE in this example.
      How the CE ACs are mapped to the PE ACs are up to the NSC
      implementation and out-of-scope in this example.

      Figure 33: Example of a Message Body to Create an CE based A2A
                              Slice Services

B.7.  Example-7: SDP at CE, L3 A2A Slice Service with Network
      Abstraction

   Figure 34 shows an example of one Network slice instance where the
   SDPs are located at the PE-facing ports on the CE.

   In this example it is assumed that the NSC already has circuit
   binding details between the CE and PE which were previously assigned
   (method is out-of-scope) or the NSC has mechanisms to determine this
   mapping.  While the NSC capabilities are out-of-scope of this
   document, the NSC may use the CE device name, "sdp-id", "sdp-ip",
   "ac-id" or the "peer-sap-id" to complete this AC circuit binding.

   We are introducing the "peer-sap-id" in this example, which in this
   case, is an operator provided identifier that the slice requester can
   use for the NSC to identify the service attachment point (saps) in an
   abstracted way.  How the NSC uses the "peer-sap-id" is out of scope
   of this document, but a possible implementation would be that the NSC
   was previously provisioned with a "peer-sap-id" to PE
   device/interface/VLAN mapping table.  Alternatively, the NSC can
   request this mapping from an external database.

   *  Network Slice 9 with SDP31 on CPE Device1, SDP33 (with two ACs) on
      Device 3 and SDP34 on Device 4, with an A2A connectivity type.
      This is a L3 Slice Service and using the uniform low-latency slo-
      sle-template policy between all SDPs.

Appendix D.  Comparison with the Design Choice of ACTN VN Model
             Augmentation

   The difference between the ACTN VN model and the Network Slice
   Service requirements is that the Network Slice Service interface is a
   technology-agnostic interface, whereas the VN model is bound to the
   TE Topologies.  The realization of the Network Slice does not
   necessarily require the slice network to support the TE technology.

   The ACTN VN (Virtual Network) model introduced
   in[I-D.ietf-teas-actn-vn-yang] is the abstract customer view of the
   TE network.  Its YANG structure includes four components:

   *  VN: A Virtual Network (VN) is a network provided by a service
      provider to a customer for use and two types of VN has defined.
      The Type 1 VN can be seen as a set of edge-to-edge abstract links.
      Each link is an abstraction of the underlying network which can
      encompass edge points of the customer's network, access links,
      intra-domain paths, and inter-domain links.

Internet-Draft      Network Slice Service YANG Model       February 2024


   *  AP: An AP is a logical identifier used to identify the access link
      which is shared between the customer and the IETF scoped Network.

   *  VN-AP: A VN-AP is a logical binding between an AP and a given VN.

   *  VN-member: A VN-member is an abstract edge-to-edge link between
      any two APs or VN-APs.  Each link is formed as an E2E tunnel
      across the underlying networks.

   The Type 1 VN can be used to describe Network Slice Service
   connection requirements.  However, the Network Slice SLOs and Network
   Slice SDPs are not clearly defined and there's no direct equivalent.
   For example, the SLO requirement of the VN is defined through the TE
   Topologies YANG model, but the TE Topologies model is related to a
   specific implementation technology.  Also, VN-AP does not define
   "service-match-criteria" to specify a specific SDP belonging to an
   Network Slice Service.
